# Find the Number Closest to Zero
Simple class project for Discrete Structures

+ This simple code takes an array as input, and then scans it and replies with the index of where the number closest to zero is located
+ Used to demonstrate fundamental algorithms learned in Discrete Structures
+ Currently it automatically generates random integers, can simply edit input source and put own array
